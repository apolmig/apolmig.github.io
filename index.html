    My life mission is to be a good dad to my three children, and I strive to leave a better world than I found, both things are very related, but not always complementary. I love to learn about everything, but specially things related to tech, science and history, I was one of those kids reading encyclopedias for fun. Also I like to have good conversations, watching movies and running outdoors.
